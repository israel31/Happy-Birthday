				<h1>Group 2 Wishes you a Happy Birthday Sir</h1>
				<text>......................................</text>
				<h2>Sis Oly Benjamin</h2>
				<p>
				Happy Birthday Sir. The esteemed Bro David Okoh, hmmmm..... I remember the first day i was told you are my new leader,
				i felt as though my world in UNIBEN was about to crumble :) , I thought of many things, I cried, it was as though my day was disorganised.
				Although i've had an encounter with you before at IPPC when you came to greet Sis. Joy Godor at the Presidential carpark, I was there with some
				SOMs and we were wondering "ahhnnn ahhnnn, where is he marching and hurrying to because of the way you walked with so much energy,
				when you left i asked her who that was and she said those are the military men of the military cantonment Zone J, they 
				are always at war, don't stress yourself" I wondered "even at IPPC".
				</p>
				<p>
					Coming to meet you here and then having you as my leader 'hmmm.....' i thougt i will be the worst but i remember the Esteemed Sis. Blessing and Esteemed
					Sis. Obaro from campus (especially) sat me down and told me her experience with you as her leader and how it changed her life, i thought to myslef "which life do they want to change in me again"
					She told me to walk with you with an open heart forgetting any impression i had and i did..... Although i've been trained in ministry to follow your new "Commander"..... So i did, not really 
					expecting anything good to come out of my experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					I saw a different Brother David in you sir than the one i knew in my mind, calm, friendly, Highly knowledgeable of the word,
					spiritual, excellent and his zeal is the words of the Man of God. I saw an ardent follower of the Man of God in him, who would anything
					for his members, Leaders and the Brethren. I liked this new Bro David i am seeing and i resolved in my mind to give this fellowship a try.
				</p>
				<p>
						Sir you are simply amazing, thank you so much for the words(you always have the right words at every point in time for every situation),  thank you Sir for your ﬁre, your zeal, your trainings and the many opportunities you give us for service. I can see people who you raised in Campus ministry and all are excelling tremendously in the work of the ministry... Thank God I met you
				</p>
				<p>
						A big amen to all Pastor's prayers and prophecies for you Sir. 
						Happy happy happy birthday to you Sir, my exceptional group leader. 
						I'm grateful to God that you we're born. I love you Sir.

						*Happy Birthday Brother David Sir ............*
						Everyone carry ﬁre, breath ﬁre,talk ﬁre but I have never seen it in a 24/7 action before until I meant Brother David Sir, my leader with exceptional Ginger, the jumping leader who thought me how to Sky jump inspite of fear of hieght, a Leader I have never seen shiver, I still remember the day he said to me/us, *I DONT NEED YOUR FAITH I WOULD MAKE IT HAPPEN* ... Those words still echo in my ears, the words that can only be said by great conqueror, never been deafeated and not ready to throw the Barton down, Sometimes I ask my self where does all those energy come from, but believe me when I say I get my answers immediately.... For Everytime I ask I see Fire the heat the exudes from you Sir is sharper than a ﬂaming sword breaking through the hardest of armor the dragon skin..... Sir I don't know if you know but for Everytime your eyes are open wide in times of prayer ѥѥѥ when we use to have those very intense meeting ...Sir Your eyes are piercing it's like staring into the eyes of the Lion, it's ﬁerce and threatening ... And when I see those eyes Sir I know to say that even the devil knows not to dare ... *In pigin just remove hand so u nor go burn yourself......* And am sure that everything would work for my Good .... Sir I can say alot but I think it would be summed up in three words Sir 
						*I LOVE YOU* *BROTHER DAVID SIR* *YOU THE BEST*

						Happy Birthday Sir. 
						I remember You were the ﬁrst person I met when I was told to report to UNIBEN Church, You were so kind to give me Your phone to make a call and the joy with which You gave it was extreme. I thought ha, this guy laughs a lot ooo. 
						Well, I wouldn't say it crossed my mind that You'll be my leader but all the same it's been very good. Initially, I wasn't sure of working with You when I was told that You're my leader (I struggled with it in my mind for a longer while though, even when I started working with You). In the Staff Community, You're always smiling and no one would think You'd shout at someone for any reason but when it comes to work (Group 2 or Rhema Senior Cell), no excuses at all. I'm always amazed at the switch from time to time.
						I've made You talk, made You shout, made You pray but still You never give up even when I told You I wasn't ready for the assignment You were giving to me. Why??? ЗЗ Sometimes then when You call for meetings, I honestly do not feel like attending but after each comes with this joy and excitement because of the atmosphere of joy You carry and give. 
						So much to say really cos I can give an epistle on our
						So much to say really cos I can give an epistle on our everyday life.
						Thank You so much Sir for loving God the way You do, for pushing for the furtherance of the Gospel. Thank You Sir for believing in me and training me... There's always a correction for me... ӖӖӖ (sometimes it gets me thinking) 
						You've occupied a very big place in my heart and You'll always be there. 
						I say amen to all of Pastor's prayers for You Si. 
						Happy Year of Perfection Sir. It's another Groove today!!!
